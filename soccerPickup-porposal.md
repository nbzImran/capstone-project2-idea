Capstone Project Proposal: Find a Pickup Soccer Game

1. Tech Stack

For this capstone project, I will be using a full-stack JavaScript approach. The frontend will be built with React, utilizing React Router and possibly a component library like Reactstrap or Material UI for styling and layout. The backend will be developed using Node.js with Express, and I will use PostgreSQL for data storage. I plan to use Mapbox or Google Maps API for geolocation and map visualization. Additional functionality such as real-time chat or notifications may be handled via WebSockets or Firebase if time permits.

2. Project Focus

This project will be a full-stack application with equal emphasis on both frontend and backend development. The frontend will feature an interactive, map-based UI for discovering and joining games, while the backend will manage game data, user accounts, RSVPs, and possibly chat or filter functionality.

3. Platform

This will be a responsive website for now, and later on accessible on both desktop and mobile browsers. The interface will be optimized for mobile users, since pickup game coordination is often done on-the-go.

4. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to make it easy for soccer enthusiasts to find and join local pickup games in their area. Users will be able to:

View local pickup games on a map

Create new games with custom locations, times, and skill levels

RSVP to join existing games

(Optional) Chat with other players in the game group

(Optional) Filter games by skill level or proximity

This project aims to address the common frustration of not knowing when and where informal games are happening, and to build a simple, community-powered platform for casual play.

5. Target Users

The app is designed for soccer players of all skill levels, especially:

Adults and teens looking to play casually or improve their skills

Newcomers to a city looking to meet local players

Recreational athletes who want to stay active without committing to a league

6. Data Sources

Most data in the app will be user-generated, including:

Game details (location, date/time, skill level)

User profiles

RSVP lists

Geolocation and mapping features will use external APIs such as Mapbox or Google Maps to retrieve location-based data and display it visually. I may also implement browser-based geolocation to suggest games near a user’s current location.

All data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database, and I'll build custom RESTful API routes with Node.js/Express to serve this data to the frontend.

Development Plan

Week 1: Set up project architecture, database schema, and initial routes for user/game data.

Week 2: Build the React UI with routing, forms for creating games, and map integration.

Week 3: Implement RSVP system and filtering; begin work on bonus features like chat.

Week 4: Polish UI/UX, test all functionality, and deploy the app.

I’m excited to bring this idea to life and learn through the process of building a full-featured web application from scratch!
